## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing a Flutter mobile application with Clean Architecture, GetX state management, and responsive design for IT product sales.

## Technology Decisions

### 1. Flutter Clean Architecture with GetX

**Decision**: Implement Clean Architecture with GetX for state management and navigation

**Rationale**: 
- Clean Architecture provides clear separation of concerns (presentation, domain, data layers)
- GetX offers reactive state management perfect for complex UI with 5 tabs
- GetX navigation system handles custom app bars per screen efficiently
- GetX dependency injection simplifies testing and maintainability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Provider: Rejected due to more boilerplate code
- Bloc: Rejected due to complexity for this scope
- Riverpod: Rejected due to learning curve and GetX's simplicity

### 2. Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: Use Flutter's MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder for responsive design

**Rationale**:
- MediaQuery provides screen dimensions for responsive calculations
- LayoutBuilder enables adaptive layouts based on available space
- Custom responsive widgets for consistent app bar sizing
- Support for 4 main screen resolutions (360x640, 375x667, 414x896, 428x926)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed breakpoints: Rejected due to limited flexibility
- Platform-specific designs: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

### 3. HTTP Client Architecture

**Decision**: Custom API client with interceptors using HTTP package

**Rationale**:
- Centralized network handling with base URL configuration
- Interceptors for authentication, logging, and error handling
- Easy switching between mock and real API
- Consistent error handling across the application

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Dio: Rejected due to additional dependency
- Direct HTTP calls: Rejected due to lack of centralized control

### 4. Theme Management

**Decision**: GetX reactive theme switching with SharedPreferences persistence

**Rationale**:
- GetX reactive programming for instant theme updates
- SharedPreferences for persistent theme storage
- Light/Dark theme support with smooth transitions
- Centralized theme management across all screens

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Provider theme: Rejected due to GetX consistency
- Manual theme switching: Rejected due to complexity

### 5. Data Management Strategy

**Decision**: Repository pattern with factory method for API/Mock switching

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation between data sources and business logic
- Easy switching between mock data and real API
- Testable architecture with dependency injection
- Factory pattern enables runtime data source selection

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct API calls: Rejected due to tight coupling
- Single data source: Rejected due to testing limitations

## Implementation Patterns

### Clean Architecture Layers

**Presentation Layer**:
- GetX Controllers for state management
- Custom widgets for reusable UI components
- Page widgets for each screen
- Binding classes for dependency injection

**Domain Layer**:
- Entities for business objects
- Repository interfaces
- Use cases for business logic
- No external dependencies

**Data Layer**:
- Repository implementations
- Data sources (local JSON, remote API)
- Data models with JSON serialization
- Network client with interceptors

### GetX Integration Patterns

**Navigation**:
- GetMaterialApp for app initialization
- AppRoutes for centralized routing
- Custom app bars per screen
- Bottom navigation with GetX state

**State Management**:
- Reactive variables with .obs
- GetXController for complex state
- Get.find() for dependency injection
- Obx() widgets for reactive UI

**Binding**:
- Separate binding classes per feature
- Lazy loading of dependencies
- Memory management with GetX

### Responsive Design Patterns

**Screen Size Calculations**:
- App bar height: 8-12% of screen height (min 48px, max 80px)
- Content padding: 4-6% of screen width
- Icon sizes: 24-32px based on screen density
- Touch targets: minimum 44px for accessibility

**Responsive Widgets**:
- Custom responsive containers
- Adaptive text sizing
- Flexible layouts for different orientations
- Consistent spacing across screen sizes

## Technical Specifications

### Flutter Configuration
- **Dart SDK**: 3.0+

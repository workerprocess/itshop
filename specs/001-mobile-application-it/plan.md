# Implementation Plan: Mobile Application สำหรับการขายสินค้า IT

**Branch**: `001-mobile-application-it` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-mobile-application-it/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-mobile-application-it/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Testing**: Flutter Test, Mockito, Integration Tests  
**Target Platform**: iOS 12+, Android API 21+  
**Project Type**: mobile (Flutter cross-platform app)  
**Performance Goals**: 60fps UI, <200ms API response, <2s app startup  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable browsing, responsive design for 4 screen sizes, Thai language support  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 main screens, 20+ functional requirements, Clean Architecture with 3 layers  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Status**: PASS
- **Test-First**: TDD approach with unit tests, integration tests, and contract tests
- **Library-First**: Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns (presentation, domain, data)
- **Simplicity**: Single Flutter project with modular structure, no unnecessary complexity

**Structure Decision**: Mobile Flutter application with Clean Architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Flutter Clean Architecture best practices with GetX
   - Responsive design patterns for multiple screen resolutions
   - GetX state management patterns for complex navigation
   - API client architecture with interceptors
   - Theme switching implementation with GetX

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Flutter Clean Architecture patterns with GetX for mobile apps"
   Task: "Find best practices for responsive design in Flutter across multiple screen sizes"
   Task: "Research GetX navigation patterns for 5-tab applications with custom app bars"
   Task: "Investigate HTTP client architecture with interceptors for Flutter"
   Task: "Research theme switching implementation using GetX state management"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Product entity with IT classification attributes
   - Category entity with international standards
   - Theme settings entity
   - User preferences entity
   - Navigation state entity

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Product listing endpoints
   - Category browsing endpoints
   - Search and filtering endpoints
   - Theme preference endpoints
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - Add Flutter/GetX specific context
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Flutter-specific: Core setup → Data layer → Domain layer → Presentation layer
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Flutter project setup and configuration
- Clean Architecture layer implementation
- GetX integration and state management
- 5-tab navigation system
- API client with interceptors
- Theme switching system
- Responsive design implementation
- Mock data and testing setup

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Clean Architecture (3 layers) | Separation of concerns for maintainable mobile app | Direct UI-to-data coupling insufficient for complex navigation and state management |
| GetX State Management | Reactive programming for complex UI state | setState insufficient for 5-tab navigation with shared state |
| API Client with Interceptors | Centralized network handling | Scattered HTTP calls insufficient for consistent error handling and logging |

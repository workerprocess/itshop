## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer looking to purchase IT products, I want to navigate through a comprehensive mobile app with multiple sections (Home, Products, Search, Favorites, Profile) so that I can easily discover, search, save, and manage my IT product shopping experience with personalized theme preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the mobile app, **When** they view the home screen, **Then** they see featured products (best sellers, recommendations) with modern, vibrant colors
2. **Given** a user wants to browse all products, **When** they tap on the Products tab, **Then** they see a comprehensive product listing page with categories
3. **Given** a user wants to find specific products, **When** they use the Search tab, **Then** they can search and filter products effectively
4. **Given** a user wants to save products for later, **When** they tap on the Favorites tab, **Then** they can view and manage their saved products
5. **Given** a user wants to manage their account, **When** they tap on the Profile tab, **Then** they can access account settings and preferences
6. **Given** a user wants to change the app appearance, **When** they toggle between Light/Dark theme, **Then** the entire app interface adapts to their preferred theme
7. **Given** a user is on any screen, **When** they navigate between tabs, **Then** each screen maintains its own appropriate app bar design

### Edge Cases
- What happens when there are no products in a category?
- How does the app handle slow network connections while loading product images?
- What happens when product categories are empty or unavailable?
- What happens when a user searches for products that don't exist?
- How does the app handle favorites when a user is not logged in?
- What happens when theme switching fails or is interrupted?
- How does the app maintain consistent app bar design across different screen sizes?
- What happens when search results return no matches?
- How does the app handle empty favorite lists?
